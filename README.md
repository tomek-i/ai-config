# AI Configs & Tools

> My personal collection of AI configurations, prompts, and tools that I use daily.

This is where I keep all my AI-related configurations and tools organized in one place. I'm constantly tweaking and adding new setups as I discover better ways to work with AI assistants and tools.

## Quick Start

Feel free to browse and copy anything that looks useful. I keep this repo as a personal reference, but you're welcome to adapt these configs for your own workflow.

**Note:** This is a living repository. I update these configs regularly as I discover new techniques or tools that work better for my needs.

## How I Use These

I maintain this repo because I work across multiple machines and environments. Instead of trying to remember all the little tweaks and optimizations I've made, I keep them all here and sync them as needed.

I update things whenever I find a better configuration or discover new tools that work well. Check the git log to see what's changed recently - I'm always experimenting!

## About This Repo

This started as a way to keep my dotfiles and AI configurations backed up, but I figured others might find some of these setups useful too. 

If you have suggestions for better configurations or tools I should check out, feel free to open an issue - I'm always looking to improve my AI workflow!

### License

These configurations are shared for personal use. Feel free to adapt them for your own needs, but please don't redistribute them commercially without asking first.
